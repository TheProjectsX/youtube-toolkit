### Why not Uploaded in Chrome Web Store?

Well, I am a `Unemployed Developer`. Don't have the means to spend 5$ just to get registered as a Developer!

# For my Fellow Developers (& Future Me!):

## How and What?

-   ### This Extension was created using React JS.
-   ### Here are the Steps::

-   Create a Regular React JS project. (Use Vite or whatever)
-   We will create our `popup` html and js as a regular React JS project.
-   The Next thing we will do in our `public` directory:
    -   Create a `manifest.json` file and add necessary `Things`.
    -   Add `index.js` as `default_popup`
    -   Create `content` script and `background` script here.
    -   Add the paths of the `content` script and `background` script in the `manifest.json` file but relative to the public folder. (Think of public folder as root directory)
    -   Read DOCs (or get help from ChatGPT) and create your Extension!!!!!!
-   And there is this Repository to Get the Ideas! (or Helps!)
